This project will recommend food nationalities for the user to try, 
based on their own favourite food nationalities.  The user will enter
their own favourite foods, as well as a number of demographics.  The
program then compares their responses to those of other survey respondants
and offers three new recommendations for the user to try.

Instructions:
1) Open "FoodRecommendations.py" in pyScripter or other python IDE.
2) Run the program.
3) As prompted, enter your demographics/food favourites.  Your information
   will not be saved.
4) Enjoy the results!
